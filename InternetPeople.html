    <p class="card-text">This is the story of how the internet has changed society and how a new breed of entrepreneurs are shaping our digital futures. It all started with Napster; a way of swapping music that was dreamt up by the teenaged Shawn Fanning. This is the last part of the series. It tells us how the Internet has changed the society and new age entrepreneurs are shaping the world by making the web interactive. The communication was uprising all around us. New generation companies like YouTube, MySpace and Facebook, turned the web into a two way participatory and democratic medium controlled by no-one and shaped by everyone. As John Heilemann in the video says, “By now we all know the web has changed the world, but this is the story of how the world is changing the web.” It was termed as Web 2.0 time when the World Wide Web sites emphasized on user generated content and social networking. Towards the end of the episode, the Founder of Craigslist says: “The web is not just about making money, it’s about setting communication free.”
