  </div>
  <div class="card-body">

    <p class="card-text">Marc Andreeson piloted the program for Mosaic, the first graphical web browser to be used on the internet. Jim Clark was a large entrepreneur who had bet a third of his net worth on Andreeson to create this internet age of software. He started Netscape alongside Andreeson and his team. Even Bill Gates did not even envision at first that the internet would take on such a scape, as he was just working to make the “Internet” a connection among all Microsoft computers, which would also have a price on it. On October 13th 1994, Netscape launched its browser called Navigator. It was an instant success.
Microsoft was afraid of Netscape as they believed their browser was going to be in their way and that everyone would consume their content, online, in this fashion instead of solely on the Microsoft network. After Navigator’s launch, Gates felt that the internet was the absolute measure to rise in the computing space. Now he pushed to get Microsoft to work on their own web browser.
Microsoft and Netscape actually sat down and met in due time to discuss the scope of the internet. Microsoft had framed it that during the meeting the two giants sat down and had a cordial 6 hour meeting about the web, servers, and how to grow. From the Netscape side of things, however, they stated that Micrsoft told them it’s either they win and maybe Netscape does as well, if not then consider yourself out of the game. They also said that Microsoft offered $1 million to essentially buy Netscape out.

    <p class="card-text">Jim Clark was, however, now pushing to take Netscape public to just keep accelerating in the software game and really take off. This was just after one year after their initiation as well, which was deemed ludicrous in most people’s minds. On the day of their IPO, their stock took off. Clark initially had put in $5 million into Netscape and on the day of their IPO he made close to $663 million.
On the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, Microsoft was now firing from their own arsenal with their web browser, Internet Explorer, to take out Netscape. In order to ensure Netscape’s demise and due to their financial backing, Microsoft was able to launch Internet Explorer for free while Netscape had to charge a cost per download. Hence, Microsoft took a majority of the market share. AOL then bought out Netscape as their usage dwindled. The government then became the next biggest enemy of Microsoft as Netscape began fading out of the equation. The government took against them for using the Windows monopoly to prevent users from accessing Netscape’s product with their predatory actions. The judges deemed Microsoft guilty for finding evidence on them trying to buy and take out Netscape. They initially wanted Microsoft to split the company in two but rescinded that as it was deemed too harsh.
