    <h5 class="card-title">Dot Com Bubble, The True Story of the Internet </h5>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">

    <p class="card-text">In the late 20th century, the Internet created a euphoric attitude toward business and inspired many hopes for the future of online commerce. For this reason, many Internet companies (known as “dot-coms”) were launched, and investors assumed that a company that operated online was going to be worth millions. Ecommerce changed the way business were conducted.  WWW came into play and the traditional ways of doing things changed. Ebay and Amazon were the giant of ecommerce during this time. This was called Commerce Revolution, this time caused a financial meltdown. The Garage played a huge role in the transition, Jeff Bezos a spreadsheet junkie luanched amazon in 1995 and the rest is history, Jeff came into the ecommerce world well prepared while Pierre Omidyar only came up with Ebay and the initial plan was to create a marketplace for regular people to compete with the big players.
Obviously, many dot-coms were not rip-roaring successes, and most that were successful were highly overvalued. As a result, many of these companies crashed, leaving investors with significant losses. In fact, the collapse of these Internet stocks precipitated the 2001 stock market crash even more so than the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Consequently, the market crash cost investors a whopping $5 trillion.

    <p class="card-text">On the whole, in the mid- to late-’90s, society’s expectations of what the Internet could offer were unrealistic. From individual dreamers to major corporations, Internet entrepreneurs were enamored with dreams of becoming dot-com millionaires (or billionaires). By and large, these entrepreneurs were inspired by companies like Amazon, eBay, and Kozmo. Of course, for every company that grew to be a multi-million dollar business, hundreds of others failed.Many investors foolishly ignored the fundamental rules of investing in the stock market, such as analyzing P/E ratios, studying market trends, and reviewing business plans. Instead, investors and entrepreneurs became preoccupied with new ideas that were not yet proven to have market potential. Furthermore, they ignored the blatant signs that the bubble was about to burst, as indicated by Larry Elliott, economics editor of “The Guardian.”
