    <p class="card-text">Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo came up with the idea of the search engine as they were trying to make a fantasy basketball team with all the info at their disposal on the web at that time, all of which was crudely stored. The start of Yahoo and web engines in general began the commercialization of the web with advertising on such a page. As users are gathered in one place you get a lot of eyes in a congregated area. With this the web boom had begun.
Excite, another search engine had also come along and crawled the web for actual terms in a web page to give you a  search result, a rudimentary version of  the search engines of today. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had launched Google soon after. They thought that of the web as a popularity contest and that the more the page was accessed or linked, then the more people thought it was useful to access. This led them to order the search results in such a fashion to give the most relevant information Excite had the opportunity to buy Google for $1 million at one point but had missed out on their chance as they didn’t think they can make money on search in this fashion.Andy Bekel invested right away in Google in $100,000 and then John Doerr invested in Google with $12 million.

    <p class="card-text">At first there was no business model involved with Google, not even the use of ads or anything. Google then however took Bill Gross’s idea in which they could track the user’s interests to understand what they would like to buy or be interested in researching about. Then companies can buy these keywords where their search for cars for example would come to the top. These keywords were coined as Adwords. It was hence a more natural way to advertise than with flashy banners and popups and made it a clean experience. It gave an effective mean to any business small or large to make their name aware with Adwords, and gave Google an ideal start to their business model.
