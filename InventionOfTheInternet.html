    <p class="card-text">From its conception, the Internet was used for a wide array of uses. Even in its infancy the use of the internet was used for large scale things such as aiding the parties in the Gulf War with intel to progress in battle. With that its freedom had carried lengths to allow users to make it a progressive environment and expand its utility. It originated in 1950 and was responsible for one-third of the total economic growth in the US in 1998.
Many great minds had ideas and innovations that would aid the world of computing and the internet. J.C.R. Licklider had a vision from the early days of computing that computers would be able to line up together to make the internet’s growth scale and with that also communication. Kleinrock developed queuing theory to line up nodes of a communication to aid with determining network speeds with two key attributes. One being demand access that the end user will not get the packets of data until they need it and the other being distributed control where no singular switch should control the network. Due to the fault possibility of Circuit Switching, the idea of packets and packet switching developed to ensure stability, with a header of each packet following the other that needs to reach an end destination and designated various nodes are put in place to keep directing the packets and keep copies of them until the packets arrives.

    <p class="card-text">Continuing with these trends of innovation, Bob Taylor created terminals to work on larger computers remotely and then expand these connections to develop a network. His initial intent was to aid researchers to access expensive computers. Then Larry Roberts built the first experimental connection between two computers directly. These innovations led to the Arpanet, which was essentially the first iteration of the internet. This is where a big computer that would be responsible for the actual computing power would attach to to a smaller one called an interface message processor or and IMP. These IMP’s had an ubiquitous system that they can interface with each other in the same fashion so regardless of the configuration of the attaches computer these computers can communicate with each other. The Arpanet first started with file sharing/data access, but then spiked with its inception of email.
TCP/IP was a standard protocol that was developed among all networks to make a communal standard that unified the internet. A big leap forward for the internet was accomplished through an act by Congress, which on June 9th, 1992 took the internet out of the hands of the government and into the public. Following this, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) which was the software that followed the threads of knowledge stored on the internet to make a more concise and categorized method of organizing data and information. Then one of the first browsers that was developed to interface with this newfound software was Netscape which was one of the very first intuitive browsers to exist for the computer.
